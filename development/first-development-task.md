#### Check Android-x86 Version
```bash
# In your Android-x86 VM:
1. Go to Settings > About Phone
2. Note the Android version
3. Check the build number
4. Document the architecture (x86/x86_64)
```

#### System Resources
```bash
# Check system specifications:
1. Go to Settings > Storage
2. Note available storage space
3. Check RAM usage in Settings > Memory
4. Document CPU information
5. Check graphics capabilities
```

### Step 2: Performance Testing

#### Boot Time Test
```bash
# Measure boot performance:
1. Restart the Android-x86 VM
2. Time from power on to usable interface
3. Document the boot time
4. Note any delays or issues
```

#### App Launch Testing
```bash
# Test app launch times:
1. Install Chrome browser
2. Time how long it takes to open
3. Test other apps (YouTube, Gmail, etc.)
4. Document average launch times
5. Note any apps that fail to launch
```

#### Multi-tasking Test
```bash
# Test multi-app functionality:
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Open YouTube app
3. Open Gmail app
4. Switch between apps
5. Test if all apps remain responsive
6. Document any performance issues
```

### Step 3: App Compatibility Testing

#### Essential Apps Test
```bash
# Install and test these apps:
1. Chrome Browser - Web browsing
2. YouTube - Video playback
3. Gmail - Email functionality
4. Google Drive - File management
5. Spotify - Audio playback
6. Instagram - Social media
7. Microsoft Office - Productivity
8. Calculator - Basic utilities
```

#### App Functionality Test
```bash
# For each app, test:
- [ ] App installs successfully
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] App functions properly
- [ ] App can be closed and reopened
- [ ] App works with other apps
- [ ] App handles window resizing (if applicable)
```

### Step 4: System Customization Test

#### Display Settings
```bash
# Test display customization:
1. Go to Settings > Display
2. Test resolution changes
3. Test brightness adjustment
4. Test screen timeout settings
5. Document any display issues
```

#### Developer Options
```bash
# Enable and test developer options:
1. Go to Settings > About Phone
2. Tap "Build Number" 7 times
3. Go to Settings > Developer Options
4. Test USB Debugging
5. Test "Stay Awake" option
6. Test "Show CPU Usage"
7. Test "Profile GPU Rendering"
```

### Step 5: Performance Benchmarking

#### Install Benchmark Apps
```bash
# Download and install:
1. Antutu Benchmark - Overall performance
2. Geekbench - CPU performance
3. 3DMark - Graphics performance
4. PCMark - System performance
5. AndroBench - Storage performance
```

#### Run Benchmarks
```bash
# Execute benchmark tests:
1. Run each benchmark app
2. Document the scores
3. Compare with standard Android devices
4. Note any failed benchmarks
5. Document performance bottlenecks
```

```

### App Compatibility
```bash
# List app compatibility:
Chrome Browser: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
YouTube: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Gmail: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Google Drive: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Spotify: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Instagram: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Microsoft Office: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Games: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
```

### Issues Found
```bash
# Document any problems:
1. ___________
2. ___________
3. ___________
4. ___________
5. ___________
```

## üéØ Next Steps Based on Results

### If Performance is Good (Boot <30s, Apps launch quickly):
```bash
# Proceed to development:
1. Start Deepin UI research
2. Begin window management design
3. Plan Android app integration
4. Create desktop environment mockups
```

### If Performance is Poor (Boot >60s, Apps slow):
```bash
# Optimize first:
1. Increase VM memory allocation
2. Enable hardware acceleration
3. Optimize Android-x86 settings
4. Consider upgrading Android-x86 version
```

### If App Compatibility is Limited:
```bash
# Research solutions:
1. Test different Android-x86 versions
2. Research compatibility fixes
3. Look into alternative solutions
4. Document compatibility issues
```

## üìù Documentation Tasks

### Create Assessment Report
```bash
# Write comprehensive report:
1. System specifications
2. Performance benchmarks
3. App compatibility results
4. Issues and limitations
5. Recommendations for improvement
