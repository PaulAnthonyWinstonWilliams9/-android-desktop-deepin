# Current Android-x86 Setup Testing

## üß™ Test Your Existing Android-x86 Installation

### Step 1: Basic Functionality Test

#### Test Android-x86 Boot
```bash
# 1. Start your Android-x86 VM
# 2. Verify it boots successfully
# 3. Check if Android interface loads
# 4. Test basic navigation
```

#### Test System Performance
```bash
# Check these metrics:
- Boot time: How long does it take to start?
- Memory usage: How much RAM is being used?
- CPU performance: Is it responsive?
- Graphics: Are animations smooth?
```

### Step 2: App Compatibility Test

#### Install Test Apps
```bash
# Download and install these apps to test compatibility:
1. Chrome Browser - Test web browsing
2. YouTube - Test video playback
3. Gmail - Test email functionality
4. Google Drive - Test file management
5. Spotify - Test audio playback
6. Instagram - Test social media apps
7. Microsoft Office - Test productivity apps
8. Games (Candy Crush, etc.) - Test gaming
```

#### Test App Performance
```bash
# For each app, test:
- Launch time: How fast does it open?
- Functionality: Does it work properly?
- Window behavior: Can it be resized?
- Multi-tasking: Can multiple apps run?
- Stability: Does it crash or freeze?
```

### Step 3: System Customization Test

#### Test System Settings
```bash
# Navigate to Android Settings and test:
1. Display settings - Resolution, brightness
2. Storage settings - Available space
3. Memory settings - RAM usage
4. Performance settings - CPU usage
5. Network settings - WiFi/Ethernet
```

#### Test Developer Options
```bash
# Enable Developer Options:
1. Go to Settings > About Phone
2. Tap "Build Number" 7 times
3. Go to Settings > Developer Options
4. Test these options:
   - USB Debugging
   - Stay Awake
   - Show CPU Usage
   - Profile GPU Rendering
```

### Step 4: Performance Benchmarking

#### Run Performance Tests
```bash
# Install and run these benchmark apps:
1. Antutu Benchmark - Overall performance
2. Geekbench - CPU performance
3. 3DMark - Graphics performance
4. PCMark - System performance
5. AndroBench - Storage performance
```

#### Document Results
```bash
# Create a performance report with:
- Boot time: ___ seconds
- Memory usage: ___ GB
- CPU usage: ___ %
- Storage space: ___ GB free
- App launch times: ___ seconds average
- Benchmark scores: ___ points
```
